# Filters_on_an-_image
It's a project made by me to implement my learnt knowledge on the real platform.
In this Project, I usually used openCv library for extracting different features of an image i.e; Gray Scale Image, Binary Image, Blue Image, Smoothing the image, Blurring the image, Detecting the edge of an image, adding Saturation in image, Converting the image into Green image, and other more features to an image.

What is computer Vision? How computer reads an image?
computer sees the image between 0-255 , for coloured images there will be 3 channels i.e;Red, Blue and Green and matrix 
associated with these channels and each elements of this matrix represents the intensity of brightness of that pixels.A 
computer interprete a coloured matrix as 3-D matrix.
Library Used:
	Open Cv	
	Numpy
Features for converting the image
